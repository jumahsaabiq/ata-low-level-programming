The 4 stages of compilation in C:

1. Preprocessing:
   This step handles all the preprocessor directives like #include and #define.
   It prepares the code by expanding macros and including header files.
2. Compiling:
   The preprocessed code is translated into assembly code that matches the target machine.
3. Assembling:
   The assembler converts the assembly code into object code (machine-readable instructions).
4. Linking:
   The linker combines all object files and libraries into a final executable program.
